This project uses a build folder called ../dist/

### Bonus
This comes with a built-in babel compiler and hot-reloader for HTML/CSS/JS.

To start this tool, install npm (or yarn) then use gulp:
`npm install && ./node_modules/.bin/gulp`

Stylelint can also be manually invoked using `./node_modules/.bin/stylelint css/*.css --fix`
